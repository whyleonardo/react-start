```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build

To build the App, run

```bash
npm run build
```

And you will see the generated file in `dist` that ready to be served.

#### Husky

If pre-commit hooks are not working be sure that you have installed husky: `husky install`.

By default this command should be triggered after yarn/npm deps are installed.

## Why

I have created several React apps recently. Setting the configs up is kinda the bottleneck for me to make the ideas simply come true within a very short time.

So I made this starter template for myself to create apps more easily, along with some good practices that I have learned from making those apps. Feel free to tweak it or even maintains your own forks.
